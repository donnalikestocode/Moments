# Moments - Practice gratitude

## Overview
I wanted to create a program that could assist users in cultivating self-love and gratitude. I strongly believe that one of life's biggest challenges is learning how to love oneself. From personal experience, I have discovered that as I began to practice gratitude more regularly, I gained a deeper understanding of myself and developed appreciation for everything I already have. Through this application, I hope to share this positive and fulfilling experience with others.

By practicing gratitude, we learn to cherish even the seemingly insignificant aspects of our lives â€“ from the hardships we endure, to the love and joy that others bring into our lives, to simply waking up each day. :heart:
